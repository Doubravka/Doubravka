# 🌸 Hi! I'm @Doubravka 🌸 

I'm a junior programmer interested in web development, data analysis and biology. 
I really like the efficiency and new possibilities programming can bring to various areas of human activity. 
I enjoy when code improves interaction with world, be it data processing and analysis or creative and functional web applications.

    
- 🐛 I'm currently learning TypeScript, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS, SQL and how to use them all
- 🐝 I'm working on my new React project!
